# Accessibility Checker API

## Setup
Setup is detailed in the `README.md` in the root folder for the project.

## Using the API
The API is designed to be used from the frontend. However, for testing, a tool like Postman which can hit an endpoint directly can be used.

All API endpoints come from the base url `http://localhost:8080/api` when run locally. For example, to hit the `/account/create` endpoint, you should hit `http://localhost:8080/api/account/create`

Any endpoints that require a login will return a `401 UNAUTHORIZED` if they are hit without first hitting the `/account/login` endpoint.
- To check if any account is logged in, hit any endpoint that requires a login (e.g. `/account/me`) and see if it returns a `401`.

All endpoints will return a `200 OK` if they succeed, and may or may not return data in the response as well.
